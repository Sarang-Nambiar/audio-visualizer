# 🎧 Audio Visualizer

![Screencast_20251020_011808](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95598dc1-47b2-4c53-9b28-a9d0271924ef)

A **React-based 3D Audio Visualizer** that transforms sound either from an uploaded file or your microphone—into stunning, real-time visuals using **Three.js** and **React-Three-Fiber (R3F)**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🎵 Visualize live microphone input or uploaded audio files
* 🌐 Built with **React**, **Three.js**, and **R3F** for smooth 3D rendering
* 🧠 Uses **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to analyze audio frequencies
* 🌊 Incorporates **Perlin Noise** for organic, fluid mesh animations

> 💡 **Tip:** Make sure GPU acceleration is enabled in your browser for the best experience.

## 🧩 How It Works

The visualizer captures audio data and transforms it into the frequency domain using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.
From this, it calculates the **average amplitude** and feeds that into **Perlin Noise** functions to smoothly deform a 3D mesh, producing an organic, pulsating visual effect that reacts in real time to sound.
